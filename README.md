# CS 131 Spring 2023: Interpreter

I'm building an interpreter for my CS 131 Programming Languages class to understand a language's function, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. When should we use a specific programming langauge? What is the best programming language for a scenario, and how should we determine that?

By building an interpreter, I hope to answer some of these questions.

In the first version of the interpreter, I have enrolled the following features:

#### Classes
  Fields\
  Methods
#### Expressions
  Booleans\
  Integer/String operations\
  Call (method)\
  New (class)
#### Statements
  If\
  While\
  Print\
  Return\
  Set\
  Begin
  
  ## Version 2: In Progress...
